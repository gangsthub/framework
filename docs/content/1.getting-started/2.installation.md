## Play online

You can start playing with Nuxt 3 in your browser using our online sandboxes:

:button-link[Play on StackBlitz]{href="https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-stackblitz" blank}
:button-link[Play on CodeSandBox]{href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-codesandbox" blank}

## New project

Open a terminal, or from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

```bash
npx nuxi init nuxt3-app
```

Open `nuxt3-app` folder in visual studio code:

```bash
code -r nuxt3-app
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [Yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [NPM]
npm install
```

::

## Development server

Now you'll be able to use `yarn dev` to start your nuxt app in development mode:

::code-group

```bash [Yarn]
yarn dev -o
```

```bash [NPM]
npm run dev -- -o
```

Well done! A browser window should automatically open for <http://localhost:3000>

## Upgrade

If you want to upgrade Nuxt to the latest version, you can use `nuxi` as well:

```bash
npx nuxi upgrade
# or
npx nuxi upgrade --force
```

What the `--force` (or `-f`) flag will do is remove `node_modules` and the lock file and it will perform a fresh install with the latest version. `nuxi` will automatically use your current package manager (`yarn` or `npm`) to install the dependencies.
